//  Interface for flightPoint objects
//      - Flight Points will hold all the necessary data
//        for each point in the flight path. Ultimately the
//        data from these points will be sent to the server
//        and used to recreate Users' flight paths. This will
//        extended to contain information such as yaw, pitch,
//        and roll as well as gimbal positioning information.
